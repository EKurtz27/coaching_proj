# Analysis of Coaching Ideology Consistency on Team Performance

## Purpose

This project seeks to synthesize sociological theories of network construction with college football performance to analyze the impacts of coaching staff construction on team performance.

## Running the Project
### As of 6/3/25

The 'On3_coaching_parsing' file uses On3's repository of coaches to compile a list of all available coaches and their full coaching histories. The final output is an ordered CSV, but the code creates intermediate JSON files at stages where research may branch off.

The 'graph_generatation' file takes this output CSV file and creates a basic network representation of the known connections between coaches. The network is currently prohibitative dense, but should be expanded in the near future and include more interactive ways to explore the data.

## Contribution
If anyone is interested in contributing to this project, please email **evankz@bu.edu** and I would be thrilled to bring you along. Particularly, I would love anyone who has experience with building interactive graphs/network representations or anyone with football experience to discuss the next steps of the project.

## Future Milestones
Primarily, the next phase of this project involves quantifying the construction of each team's coaching staff. I am happy to expand on the plans for this quantification personally.
